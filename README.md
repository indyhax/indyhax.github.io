### AI Agent Requirements

Participants must build an **AI Agent** using resources from industry-leading providers:
- **Google AI Resources** (such as Gemini API, Google Cloud AI)
- **Microsoft AI Resources** (such as Azure AI, Copilot API)

The AI Agent should provide intelligent features such as:
- Smart task prioritization
- Deadline reminders and intelligent scheduling
- Assignment difficulty assessment
- Study time recommendations
- Natural language interaction for adding tasks
- Personalized productivity insights

## Presentation & Judging

Teams will present their projects to a panel of judges, demonstrating:
