## About IndyHAX

Welcome to **IndyHAX**, an innovative hackathon hosted at **Independence High School**! This event brings together creative minds to build cutting-edge solutions that leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence to improve student life.

## Event Details

- **Location:** Independence High School
- **Date:** To Be Determined (TBD)
- **Focus:** AI-Powered Student Tools

## The Challenge

### Build an AI-Powered Student Assignment & To-Do Tracker

Students are challenged to create a **web-based platform** that helps their peers manage their academic life more effectively. The platform should include:

- **Google AI Resources** (such as Gemini API, Google Cloud AI)
- **Microsoft AI Resources** (such as Azure AI, Copilot API)

The AI Agent should provide intelligent features such as:
- Smart task prioritization
- Deadline reminders and intelligent scheduling
- Assignment difficulty assessment
- Study time recommendations
- Natural language interaction for adding tasks
- Personalized productivity insights

## Presentation & Judging

Teams will present their projects to a panel of judges, demonstrating:

1. **Functionality:** How the AI-powered platform works
